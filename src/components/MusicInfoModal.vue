            <h2>DJ</h2>
            <p>I'm all about the groove, and happy to bring it to your next event. While my club chops are solid, My style shines the most in a lounge setting. My comfort zone and repetoire are most expansive in the space where dance meets chill. In addition, I love to DJ at yoga events, and as a practitioner find a ton of satisfaction in bringing the right vibes to your Vinyasa.</p>

            <h2>Music Production</h2>
            <p>After starting as a bedroom producer, I was able to hone my chops and give my sound a more professional sheen after working for 2 years at StoneCutter Recording Studios in Chicago. If you're looking to record at a studio and want to bring your pop, hip-hop, electro-folk, or chill style to a bigger, groovier, and more-modern level, I'm the guy to bring on. I've worked on tracks rangin from Chicago's drill underground all the way up to platinum recording artist Twista. With project management experience in the studio, I know the drill and can help you work more fluidly and efficiently with your engineer or studio owner.</p>
