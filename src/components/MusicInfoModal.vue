            <p>I'm been involved with music in some capacity for the vast majority of my life. Early on I performed as a singer-songwriter, but eventually decided to learn to record and produce. My journey with music production has been fulfilling and exciting, bringing me to collaborations with Twista, Primeaux and Mike, talented members of the Chicago underground music scene, and the Signal To Noise collective here in Denver, where I developed a 30-minute composition for an Apogaea & Burning Man art installation featuring 360 degree immersive sound.</p>
            <p>I aim to fill spaces with sounds that encourage consciousness. I left the Chicago lounge and club scene to hang my hat with the Front Range Yoga and Ecstatic Dance scenes. My styles lean towards a deep, organic South American vibe, with plenty of funk to tie things together.</p>
            <p>I'm always open to take on work or collaborate in any of the following capacities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>DJing</li>
                <li>Mixing</li>
                <li>Mastering</li>
                <li>Beats</li>
                <li>Backing Tracks</li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>I am actively seeking opportunities to DJ in Yoga and Ecstatic Dance spaces.</i></p>
            <p>Check out some of my mixes, independent tracks, and studio-produced works here on this site to get an idea of what I'm creating. Contact me for more information.</p>
