    <h1 class="color">Evolving - Just as Technology Does</h1>
    <p class="color">My passion has always lied in creativity. Creative outlets and expression are the keys to my happiness.
    <br><br>I have found that the creative chops I learned in the recording studio as a producer have benefitted my ability to solve problems with code. On the flip-side, the difficult methods I've learned with code have inspired me to take a more cerebral, methodical approach to making music. This has recently sparked a renewal in visual art as well, an expression that has been dormant since I was a child.
    <br><br>
    Currently, I'm employed as a Software Developer with an emphasis on the front-end at AUTOPAY. Aside from producing and coding, I'm a DJ. For fun I love to cook, ski, camp, hike, practice yoga, and learn about all things tech. If you'd like to discuss front-end architecture, Tweezer jams, fresh pow and the joys of shredding it, The Spirit Realm, or how to make that song you wrote into a pulsing track, hit me up!</p>
