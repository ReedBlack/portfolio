    <h1>An artist at heart</h1>
    <p>My passion has always lied in creativity. Creative outlets and expression are the keys to my happiness. After many years honing my service chops, I realized it was time to enter a field where I could be creative not only on my free time, but also on the job. While the recording industry provided this for me for some time, I felt it was too similar to my away-from-work hobby. Expansion, I decided, was the key to a more fulfilling life. 
<br><br>
It was upon this revelation that I decided to become a developer. I have found that the creative chops I learned in the studio have benefitted my ability to solve problems with code. On the flip-side, the difficult methods I've learned with code have inspired me to take a more cerebral, methodical approach to making music. 
<br><br>
I am currently a student of the Galvanize Full Stack Development program. I love to build from scratch, but I also enjoy editing code to make it function the way you need. In the coming months I will be on the hunt for a job in the greater Denver or Chicago areas to meet your needs for front and/or back end development. I have learned that little in life is more satisfying than the learning process, and plan to continue self-educating long after my graduation. As such, I'd be excited to work for a company who's language requirements may not be those I'm currently fluent with. I'm especially interested in companies that deal with music in any way, shape, or fashion. 
<br><br>
Aside from producing and coding, I'm a DJ. For fun I love to cook, ski, camp, hike, practice yoga, and learn about all things tech. If you're looking to add a creative spark to your development team, please reach out!</p>
