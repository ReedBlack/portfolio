    <h1>Evolving - Just as Technology Does</h1>
    <p>My passion has always lied in creativity. Creative outlets and expression are the keys to my happiness. After many years honing my service chops, I realized it was time to enter a field where I could be creative not only on my free time, but also on the job. While the recording industry provided this for me for some time, I felt it was too similar to my away-from-work hobby. Expansion, I decided, was the key to a more fulfilling life. 
<br><br>
It was upon this revelation that I decided to become a developer. I have found that the creative chops I learned in the studio have benefitted my ability to solve problems with code. On the flip-side, the difficult methods I've learned with code have inspired me to take a more cerebral, methodical approach to making music. I'm currently finishing up my curriculem at Galvanize and looking to find the right fit on the other side.
<br><br>
Aside from producing and coding, I'm a DJ. For fun I love to cook, ski, camp, hike, practice yoga, and learn about all things tech. If you're looking to add a creative spark to your development team, please reach out!</p>
